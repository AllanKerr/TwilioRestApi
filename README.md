# TwilioRestApi

This unoffical Twilio API is designed to interface with the Twilio REST API through google app engine. It was created due to problems with the official Twilio Java API caused by multithreading in the HTTP library. This library uses HttpURLConnection which is officially supported by google app engine.

For reference on what API calls do visit https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest.

**Disclaimer:** This is an unofficial API and I not affiliated with Twilio in any way.
